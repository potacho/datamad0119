This architecture allows fast, flexible deployment, feature flexibility, efficient use of programmer resources, and rapid adapting, including scaling, to unpredictable resource requirements. These are all goals businesses feel increasingly pressured to achieve to keep up with nimble competitors.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are four aspects of the Next Architecture, each of which shows up in the platform’s search and usage data.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure id=\"id-5dEi7\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"iimages3-2018-next-architecture-oreilly-online-learning-platormjpg\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/3-2018-next-architecture-oreilly-online-learning-platorm-9e7a918b117bb7ba01540715968ce40d.jpg\">\\r\\n<figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 3. </span>AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, and Microservices—each representing an important part of the Next Architecture—appear in the top search terms from the O’Reilly online learning platform</figcaption>\\r\\n</figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Decomposition</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Organizations get a lot of benefits by breaking large and complex activities into small, loosely connected pieces. Through decomposition, these activities can be turned into standalone services that can be developed independently and linked together to create a more complex application. Microservices, the manifestation of decomposition, was the number 13 search term on our online learning platform in 2018.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Cloud</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>An organization needs the flexibility to adjust, scale, and innovate its digital presence—often across different time zones and geographies. The cloud supports these goals with compute instances that are fungible, coming and going as needed, and easy to replace automatically if failures are detected. The move toward decomposition (microservices) helps accelerate the trend toward the cloud by providing more impetus for quickly spinning up and managing services that support the need for dynamic, adaptable applications.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Cloud-related terms had a significant presence in the search and usage data. AWS, Amazon’s suite of cloud-based tools, was the number 4 search term, and it had 28% growth in year-over-year usage. Google Cloud (66% growth in usage over 2017) and Microsoft Azure (60% growth in usage) also increased. In addition, the topic “cloud migration” was up 40% in usage in 2018.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Containers</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Containers provide a lightweight way to achieve the modularity favored by decomposition and the cloud. Docker, the number 7 search term in 2018, makes it easy to automate the deployment of the microservices that are created through decomposition.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Orchestration</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The huge number of microservices running on containers—often in the hundreds or thousands—exceeds the capacity of humans to track and manage them. Orchestration tools, notably Kubernetes, fill the gap through rigorous specifications and automation. Kubernetes was the number 5 search term in 2018, jumping 11 spots, and usage growth was up a notable 160% year over year.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We’ll continue to explore the Next Architecture in the coming months.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Keep an eye on blockchain</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Blockchain, which was one of the stars in our <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/7-on-the-rise-technology-trends-to-track-and-learn\">2017 results</a>, jumped seven spots in the top search terms (number 13), and it was up 36% in usage in 2018. Ethereum, a tool for implementing blockchains, was up 66% in year-over-year usage from a small base. Platform subscribers were likely exploring blockchain to assess its potential, developing an awareness of where blockchain may fit into their strategic plans or evaluating it as an existential threat, mostly in the areas of payments, supply chain logistics, and provenance.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Python, Java, and JavaScript continue their dominance</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In 2018 we saw Python, Java, and JavaScript maintain the strong positions they’ve gained on our online learning platform over the years.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Python gets a boost, in part, from the increased interest in machine learning (ML). Many ML libraries, such as TensorFlow, are wrapped in Python libraries and promoted with Python interfaces. Ascendant ML tools also bolster interest in Python. For example, PyTorch, a library for computer vision and natural language processing, saw a 300% increase in year-over-year usage from a small base, and scikit-learn, another Python-based machine learning library, was up 39% in usage.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Many tools used in big data applications—notably the ones from the Apache Foundation, such as Spark and Kafka—feature Java interfaces. Thus, machine learning and big data may explain the popularity of both Python <em>and</em> Java. Java also remains a workhorse language for large-scale applications.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The JavaScript ecosystem of web frameworks and libraries saw less growth than Java and Python. However, usage trends show engagement with the popular JavaScript web frameworks. Angular was up 23% in usage, and React was up 39%, though search activity on both topics was flat. A third JavaScript framework, Vue, showed big usage growth, up 220% from a small base.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>After JavaScript, one more language appears in our top searches. Go, the number 11 search term, jumped three spots in the top search results, and content usage was up 14%. Go sits conveniently between high-level languages, interpreted languages like Python, and low-level, fast systems-compiled languages like C. It combines the syntactic ease of the high-level languages with compiler-driven performance, good concurrency support, an active and growing developer community, and the full support of Google. When performance matters, or when an app or service written in a high-level language needs a performance boost, Go is (sorry for the pun) the go-to language for an increasing number of developers.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Finally, the fastest usage growth we saw for any language between 2017 and 2018 was for Rust (up 44%). Rust is a systems language with near-C performance, safe, efficient memory management, native concurrency support, and a modern syntax. Developers are increasingly finding Rust a good fit when performance is or becomes a priority.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Other findings</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>There are a few more items from the analysis that are worth calling out.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>Machine learning (ML), the number 10 search term, has been a leader on our learning platform for more than a year, as we showed in <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/7-on-the-rise-technology-trends-to-track-and-learn\">last year\\'s trends</a>. In 2018 we saw a change in the distribution of interest in ML topics within the search and usage results. There was less growth in exploratory topics and phrases like “machine learning” and “deep learning.” This was coupled with a shift toward more specific topics like “natural language processing” (up 22% in search and 11% in usage) and “reinforcement learning” (up 122% in search and 331% in usage from a small base). We attribute the shift to the maturation of the ML topic and a move beyond exploration toward more engaged implementation. This is a trend reinforced by the <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/state-of-machine-learning-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">ML and artificial intelligence surveys</a> we’ve run.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>A 5% increase in usage for business-related material on the platform highlights the importance of tech for every facet of a business. It also aligns with the idea that all companies are now tech companies.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Security content went up 6% in usage in 2018, which is a good sign since we’ve noted in the past that security was underappreciated. Increased scrutiny from notable breaches may partly explain the increase. The development of distributed systems also presents new security challenges organizations must confront.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Web and mobile topics showed slight but noticeable declines in search and usage. We think the decline relates to maturity and a semantic transition. Organizations no longer pursue “web” and “mobile” computing; the web and mobile are now endemic enough that it’s all just “computing.”</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Looking ahead</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The rise of the Next Architecture, the maturation of blockchain, and emerging patterns in programming languages are areas of focus for us in the year ahead. We’ll continue to examine search and usage data on the platform, and we’ll also engage in research via conversations with our <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/conferences/\">conference</a> speakers and attendees, through perspectives from our community of practitioners and thought leaders, from media coverage, and from other sources. Ultimately, we want to see if these additional signals reinforce or challenge the findings from our platform data.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<hr>\\r\\n<aside data-type=\"sidebar\" id=\"id-6QASL\">\\r\\n<div id=\"ftn1\">\\r\\n<p><sup>[1]</sup> This article is based on non-personally-identifiable information about the top search terms and topics on the O’Reilly online learning platform in 2018.</p>\\r\\n</div>\\r\\n</aside>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/3-emerging-trends-tech-leaders-should-watch\\'>3 emerging trends tech leaders should watch.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/i_S6OMAOBLk\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}], 'summary': '<p><img src=\\'https://d3ucjech6zwjp8.cloudfront.net/600x450/learning-radar-sky-crop-1fc56cd7d97529bebaa486c6bf71a791.jpg\\'/></p><p><em>Analysis of the O’Reilly online learning platform reveals a new approach to technical architecture, the rise of blockchain, and shifts in programming language adoption.</em></p><p>Keeping up with technology can be a daunting task for tech leaders.

In this post, I’ll describe some of the key areas of interest and concern highlighted by respondents from Europe, while describing how some of these topics will be covered at the upcoming <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-eu\">Strata Data conference in London</a> (April 29 - May 2, 2019).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As interest in machine learning (ML) and AI grow, organizations are realizing that model building is but one aspect they need to plan for. Given the end-to-end nature of many data products and applications, sustaining ML and AI requires a host of tools and processes, ranging from collecting, cleaning, and harmonizing data, understanding what data is available and who has access to it, being able to trace changes made to data as it travels across a pipeline, and many other components. Our survey showed that companies are beginning to build some of the foundational pieces needed to sustain ML and AI within their organizations:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-5vyir\"><img alt=\"companies are beginning to build some of the foundational pieces needed to sustain ML and AI\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-236c48621401f8686143e6fcb5562dfd.png\"></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Solutions, including those for data governance, data lineage management, data integration and ETL, need to integrate with existing big data technologies used within companies. To that end, we also asked respondents what technologies (open source, managed services) they use for things like data storage, data management, and data processing. For example, the chart below lists popular (batch and streaming) data processing tools used by respondents based in Europe:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6nGie\"><img alt=\"popular (batch and streaming) data processing tools used by respondents based in Europe\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure2-611a1bf57d9482eca5f315129c8dc232.png\"></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Many of the systems listed in the previous chart—Apache Spark, Kafka, Hadoop, etc.,—have been in use at enterprises across the globe for several years.

It\\'s basically a birdie \"thumbs up\": fluffing her feathers or twitching a wing to show that she likes the song. We haven\\'t noticed because a bird\\'s mental processing is much faster than ours.

DJ Patil, Hilary Mason, and I have <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-five-cs\">written about it</a>, as have many others. It\\'s rightfully part of every code of data ethics I\\'ve seen. But I have to admit misgivings—not so much about the need for consent, but about what it means. Obtaining consent to collect and use data isn\\'t the end of the process; at best, it\\'s the beginning, and perhaps not a very good one.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Helen Nissenbaum, in an <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/09/stop-thinking-about-consent-it-isnt-possible-and-it-isnt-right\">interview with Scott Berinato</a>, articulates some of the problems. It\\'s easy to talk about informed consent, but what do we mean by \"informed\"? Almost everyone who reads this article has consented to some kind of medical procedure; did any of us have a real understanding of what the procedure was and what the risks were? We rely on the prestige or status of the doctor, but unless we\\'re medical professionals, or have done significant online research, we have, at best, a vague notion of what\\'s going to happen and what the risks are. In medicine, for the most part, things come out all right. The problems with consent to data collection are much deeper.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The problem starts with the origin of the consent criterion. It comes from medicine and the social sciences, in which consenting to data collection and to being a research subject has a substantial history. It arose out of experiments with mind-boggling ethical problems (for example, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_syphilis_experiment\">Tuskeegee syphilis experiment</a>), and it still isn\\'t always observed (paternalism is still a thing). \"Consent\" in medicine is limited: whether or not you understand what you\\'re consenting to, you are consenting to a single procedure (plus emergency measures if things go badly wrong). The doctor can\\'t come back and do a second operation without further consent. And likewise, \"consent\" in the social sciences is limited to a single study: you become a single point in an array of data that ceases to exist when the study is complete.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That may have been true years ago, but those limitations on how consent is used seem very shaky, as Nissenbaum argues. Consent is fundamentally an assurance about context: consenting to a medical procedure means the doctors do their stuff, and that\\'s it. The outcome might not be what you want, but you\\'ve agreed to take the risk. But what about the insurance companies? They get the data, and they can repackage and exchange it. What happens when, a few years down the road, you\\'re denied coverage because of a \"pre-existing condition\"? That data has moved beyond the bounds of an operating room. What happens when data from an online survey or social media profile is shared with another organization and combined and re-combined with other data? When it is used in other contexts, can it be de-anonymized and used to harm the participants? That single point in an array of data has now become a constellation of points feeding many experiments, not all of which are benign.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I\\'m haunted by the question, \"what are users consenting to?\" Technologists rarely think through the consequences of their work carefully enough; but even if they did, there will always be consequences that can\\'t be foreseen or understood, particularly when data from different sources is combined. So, consenting to data collection, whether it\\'s clicking on the ever-present checkbox about cookies or agreeing to Facebook\\'s license agreement, is significantly different from agreeing to surgery. We really don\\'t know how that data is used, or might be used, or could be used in the future. To use Nissenbaum\\'s language, we don\\'t know where data will flow, nor can we predict the contexts in which it will be used.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Consent frequently isn\\'t optional, but compelled. Writing about the #DeleteFacebook movement, Jillian York argues that for many, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/what-deletefacebook-tech-bros-don-t-get-without-viable-alternatives-ncna860286\">deleting Facebook is not an option</a>: \"for people with marginalized identities, chronic illnesses, or families spread across the world, walking away [from Facebook] means leaving behind a potentially vital safety net of support.\" She continues by writing that small businesses, media outlets, artists, and activists rely on it to reach audiences. While no one is compelled to sign up, or to remain a user, for many \"deleting facebook\" means becoming a non-entity. If Facebook is your only way to communicate with friends, relatives, and support communities, refusing \"consent\" may not be an option; consent is effectively compelled. The ability to withdraw consent from Facebook is a sign of privilege. If you lack privilege, an untrustworthy tool may be better than no tool at all.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One alternative to consent is the idea that you own the data and should be compensated for its use. Eric Posner, Glen Weyl, and others have <a href=\"http://ericposner.com/on-cultural-monopsonies-and-data-as-labor/\">made this argument</a>, which essentially substitutes a market economy for consent: if you pay me enough, I\\'ll let you use my data. However, markets don’t solve many problems. In \"<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/612588/its-time-for-a-bill-of-data-rights/\">It\\'s time for a bill of data rights</a>,\" Martin Tisne argues that data ownership is inadequate. When everything you do creates data, it\\'s no more meaningful to own your \"digital shadow\" than your physical one. How do you \"own\" your demographic profile? Do you even \"own\" your medical record? Tisne writes: \"A person doesn’t \\'own\\' the fact that she has diabetes—but she can have the right not to be discriminated against because of it... But absent government regulation to prevent health insurance companies from using data about preexisting conditions, individual consumers lack the ability to withhold consent. ... Consent, to put it bluntly, does not work.\" And it doesn\\'t work whether or not consent is mediated by a market. At best, the market may give some incremental income, but at worst, it gives users incentives to act against their best interest.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It\\'s also easy to forget that in many situations, users <em>are</em> compensated for their data: we\\'re compensated by the services that Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Amazon provide. And that compensation is significant; how many of us could do our jobs without Google? The economic value of those services to me is large, and the value of my data is actually quite limited. To Google, the dozens of Google searches I do in a day are worth a few cents at most. Google\\'s market valuation doesn\\'t derive from the value of my data or yours in isolation, but the added value that comes from aggregating data across billions of searches and other sources. Who owns that added value? Not me. An economic model for consent (I consent to let you use my data if you pay me) misses the point: data’s value doesn’t live with the individual.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It would be tragic to abandon consent, though I agree with Nissenbaum that we urgently need to get beyond \"incremental improvement to consent mechanisms.\" It is time to recognize that consent has serious limitations, due partly to its academic and historical origins. It\\'s important to gain consent for participation in an experiment; otherwise, the subject isn\\'t a participant but a victim. However, while understanding the consequences of any action has never been easy, the consent criterion arose when consequences were far more limited and data didn\\'t spread at the speed of light.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>So, the question is: how do we get beyond consent? What kinds of controls can we place on the collection and use of data that align better with the problems we\\'re facing? Tisne suggests a \"data bill of rights\": a set of general legal principles about how data can be used. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\">GDPR</a> is a step in this direction; the <a href=\"https://www.montrealdeclaration-responsibleai.com/the-declaration\">Montreal Declaration for the Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence</a> could be reformulated as a \"bill of data rights.\" But a data bill of rights assumes a new legal infrastructure, and by nature such infrastructures place the burden of redress on the user. Would one bring a legal action against Facebook or Google for violation of one\\'s data rights? <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/technology/google-europe-gdpr-fine.html\">Europe\\'s enforcement of GDPR</a>\\xa0will provide an important test case, particularly since this case is essentially about data flows and contexts. It isn\\'t clear that our current legal institutions can keep pace with the many flows and contexts in which data travels.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Nissenbaum starts from the knowledge that data moves, and that the important questions aren\\'t around how our data is used, but where our data travels. This shift in perspective is important precisely because data sets become more powerful when they\\'re combined; because it isn\\'t possible to anticipate all the ways data might be used; and because once data has started flowing, it\\'s very hard to stop it. But we have to admit we don\\'t yet know how to ask for consent about data flows or how to prove they are under control. Which data flows should be allowed? Which shouldn\\'t? We want to enable medical research on large aggregated data sets without jeopardizing the insurance coverage of the people whose data are in those sets. Data would need to carry metadata with it that describes where it could be transferred and how it could be used once it\\'s transferred; it makes no sense to talk about controlling data flows if that control can\\'t be automated.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-automation-in-machine-learning\">As Ben Lorica and I have argued</a>, the only way forward is through more automation, not less; issues of scale won\\'t let us have it any other way. In a conversation, Andrew Zaldivar told me of his work with Margaret Mitchell, Timnit Gebru, and others, on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993\">model cards</a> that describe the behavior of a machine learning model, and of Timnit Gebru\\'s work on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010\"><em>Datasheets for Datasets</em></a>, which specify how a data set was collected, how it is intended to be used, and other information. Model cards and data set datasheets are a step toward the kind of metadata we\\'d need to automate control over data flows, to build automated tools that manage where data can and can\\'t travel, to protect public goods as well as personal privacy. In the past year, we’ve seen how easy it is to be overly optimistic about tool building, but we are all already using data at the scale of Google and Facebook. There will need to be human systems that override automatic control over data flows, but automation is an essential ingredient.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Consent is the first step along the path toward ethical use of data, but not the last one.

Ever since then, economists have endeavored to make their discipline into a science like physics. They aspire to formulate theories that accurately explain and predict the economic activities of human beings at the micro and macro levels. This desire gathered momentum in the early 20th century with economists like Irving Fisher and culminated in the Econophysics movement of the late 20th century.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-5vyir\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*QSpg0XDon11MD4Rd\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Image by Mike Shwe and Deepak Kanungo.

For instance, physics can predict the motion of the moon and the electrons in your computer with jaw-dropping precision. These predictions can be calculated by any physicist, at any time, anywhere on the planet. By contrast, market participants have trouble explaining the causes of daily market movements or predicting the price of a stock at any time, anywhere in the world.</p>\\n<p>Perhaps finance is harder than physics. Unlike atoms and pendulums, people are complex, emotional beings with free will and latent cognitive biases. They tend to behave inconsistently and continually react to the actions of others. Furthermore, market participants profit by beating or gaming the systems in which they operate.</p>\\n<p>After losing a fortune on his investment in the South Sea Company, Newton remarked, “I can calculate the movement of the stars, but not the madness of men.” Note that Newton was not “retail dumb money.” He served as the Warden of the Mint in England for almost 31 years, helping put the British pound on the gold standard where it would stay for over two centuries.</p>\\n<h2>All financial models are wrong</h2>\\n<p>Models are used to simplify the complexity of the real world, thus enabling us to focus on the features of a phenomenon that interests us. Clearly, a map will not be able to capture the richness of the terrain it models. George Box, a statistician, famously quipped, “All models are wrong, but some are useful.”</p>\\n<p>This observation is particularly applicable to finance. Some academics have even argued that financial models are not only wrong, but also dangerous; the veneer of a physical science lulls adherents of economic models into a false sense of certainty about the accuracy of their predictive powers. This blind faith has led to many disastrous consequences for their adherents and for society at large. The most successful hedge fund in history, Renaissance Technologies, has put its critical views of financial theories into practice. Instead of hiring people with a finance or Wall Street background, they prefer to hire physicists, mathematicians, statisticians, and computer scientists. They trade the markets using quantitative models based on non-financial theories such as information theory, data science, and machine learning.</p>\\n<p>Whether financial models are based on academic theories or empirical data mining strategies, they are all subject to the trinity of modeling errors explained below. All models, therefore, need to quantify the uncertainty inherent in their predictions. Errors in analysis and forecasting may arise from any of the following modeling issues: using an inappropriate functional form, inputting inaccurate parameters, or failing to adapt to structural changes in the market.</p>\\n<h2>The trinity of modeling errors</h2>\\n<p><strong>1. Errors in model specification:</strong> Almost all financial theories use the normal distribution in their models. For instance, the normal distribution is the foundation upon which Markowitz’s Modern Portfolio Theory and Black-Scholes-Merton Option Pricing Theory are built. However, it is a well documented fact that stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities have fat-tailed distributions. In other words, extreme events occur far more frequently than predicted by the normal distribution.</p>\\n<p>If asset price returns were normally distributed, none of the following financial disasters would occur within the age of the universe: Black Monday, the Mexican Peso Crisis, Asian Currency Crisis, the bankruptcy of Long Term Capital Management (which incidentally was led by two “Nobel-prize” winning economists), or the Flash Crash. “Mini flash crashes” of individual stocks occur with even higher frequency than these macro events.</p>\\n<p>Yet, finance textbooks, programs, and professionals continue to use the normal distribution in their asset valuation and risk models because of its simplicity and analytical tractability. These reasons are no longer justifiable given today’s advanced algorithms and computational resources. This reluctance in abandoning the normal distribution is a clear example of “the drunkard’s search”: a principle derived from a joke about a drunkard who loses his key in the darkness of a park but frantically searches for it under a lamppost because that’s where the light is.</p>\\n<p><strong>2. Errors in model parameter estimates:</strong> Errors of this type may arise because market participants have access to different levels of information with varying speeds of delivery. They also have different levels of sophistication in processing abilities and different cognitive biases. These factors lead to profound epistemic uncertainty about model parameters.</p>\\n<p>Let’s consider a specific example of interest rates. Fundamental to the valuation of any financial asset, interest rates are used to discount uncertain future cash flows of the asset and estimate its value in the present. At the consumer level, for example, credit cards have variable interest rates pegged to a benchmark called the prime rate. This rate generally changes in lock-step with the federal funds rate, an interest rate of seminal importance to the U.S. and the world economies.</p>\\n<p>Let’s imagine that you would like to estimate the interest rate on your credit card one year from now. Suppose the current prime rate is 2% and your credit card company charges you 10% plus prime. Given the strength of the current economy, you believe the Federal Reserve is more likely to raise interest rates than not. The Fed will meet eight times in the next 12 months and will either raise the federal funds rate by 0.25% or leave it at the previous level.</p>\\n<p>In the following TFP code example (see entire <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/probability/blob/master/tensorflow_probability/examples/jupyter_notebooks/Credit_Card_Interest.ipynb\">Colab</a>), we use the binomial distribution to model your credit card’s interest rate at the end of the 12-month period. Specifically, we’ll use the TensorFlow Probability <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/distributions/Binomial\">Binomial</a> distribution class with the following parameters: total_count = 8 (number of trials or meetings), probs = {0.6, 0.7,0 .8, 0.9}, for our range of estimates about the probability of the Fed raising the federal funds rate by 0.25% at each meeting.</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n# First we encode our assumptions.\\nnum_times_fed_meets_per_year = 8.\\npossible_fed_increases = tf.range(\\nstart=0.,\\nlimit=num_times_fed_meets_per_year + 1)\\npossible_cc_interest_rates = 2. + 10. + 0.25 * possible_fed_increases \\nprob_fed_raises_rates = tf.constant([0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9])</pre>\\n\\n<pre>\\n# Now we use TFP to compute probabilities in a vectorized manner.\\n# Pad a dim so we broadcast fed probs against CC interest rates.\\nprob_fed_raises_rates = prob_fed_raises_rates[…, tf.newaxis]\\nprob_cc_interest_rate = <strong>tfd.Binomial</strong>(\\ntotal_count=num_times_fed_meets_per_year,\\nprobs=prob_fed_raises_rates).prob(possible_fed_increases)</pre>\\n\\n<p>In the graphs below, notice how the probability distribution for your credit card rate in 12 months depends critically on your estimate about the probability of the Fed raising rates at each of the eight meetings. You can see that for every increase of 0.1 in your estimate of the Fed raising rates at each meeting, the expected interest rate for your credit card in 12 months increases by about 0.2%.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6eQin\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*7gRb9Q0cnU8NpnDH\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Image by Josh Dillion and Deepak Kanungo. Used with permission.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n<p>Even if all market participants used the binomial distribution in their models, it’s easy to see how they could disagree about the future prime rate because of the differences in their estimate for probs. Indeed, this parameter is hard to estimate. Many institutions have dedicated analysts, including previous employees of the Fed, analyzing the Fed’s every document, speech, and event to try to estimate this parameter.</p>\\n<p>Recall that we assumed this parameter probs was constant in our model for each of the next eight Fed meetings. How realistic is that? Members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the rate setting body, are not just a set of biased coins. They can and do change their individual biases based on how the economy changes over time. The assumption that the parameter probs will be constant over the next 12 months is not only unrealistic, but also risky.</p>\\n<p><strong>3. Errors from the failure of a model to adapt to structural changes:</strong> The underlying data-generating stochastic process may vary over time—i.e., the process is not stationary ergodic. We live in a dynamic capitalist economy characterized by technological innovations and changing monetary and fiscal policies. Time-variant distributions for asset values and risks are the rule, not the exception. For such distributions, parameter values based on historical data are bound to introduce errors into forecasts.</p>\\n<p>In our example above, if the economy were to show signs of slowing down, the Fed might decide to adopt a more neutral stance in its fourth meeting, making you change your probs parameter from 70% to 50% going forward. This change in your probs parameter will in turn change the forecast of your credit card interest rate.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes the time-variant distributions and their parameters change continuously or abruptly, as in the Mexican Peso Crisis. For either continuous or abrupt changes, the models used will need to adapt to evolving market conditions. A new functional form with different parameters might be required to explain and predict asset values and risks in the new regime.</p>\\n<p>Suppose after the fifth meeting in our example, the U.S. economy is hit by an external shock—say a new populist government in Greece decides to default on its debt obligations. Now the Fed may be more likely to cut interest rates than to raise them. Given this structural change in the Fed’s outlook, we will have to change the binomial probability distribution in our model to a trinomial distribution with appropriate parameters.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\\n<p>Finance is not a precise predictive science like physics. Not even close. So, let’s not treat academic theories and models of finance as if they were models of quantum physics.</p>\\n<p>All financial models, whether based on academic theories or data mining strategies, are at the mercy of the trinity of modeling errors. While this trifecta of errors can be mitigated with appropriate modeling tools, it cannot be eliminated. There will always be asymmetry of information and cognitive biases. Models of asset values and risks will change over time due to the dynamic nature of capitalism, human behavior, and technological innovation.</p>\\n<p>Financial models need a framework that quantifies the uncertainty inherent in predictions of time-variant stochastic processes. Equally importantly, the framework needs to continually update the model or its parameters—or both—based on materially new data sets. Such models will have to be trained using small data sets, since the underlying environment may have changed too quickly to collect a sizable amount of relevant data.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\\n<p>We thank the TensorFlow Probability team, especially <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mikeshwe\">Mike Shwe</a> and Josh Dillon, for their help in earlier drafts of this blog post.</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em><a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-money-formula/9781119358619/\">The Money Formula</a></em>, by David Orrell and Paul Wilmott, Wiley, 2017</li>\\n<li>\\n<em><a href=\"http://www.stat.rice.edu/~thomp/papers/nobelsfornonsens.pdf\">Nobels For Nonsense</a></em>, by J.R.

Specifically, we’ll use the TensorFlow Probability <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/api_docs/python/tfp/distributions/Binomial\">Binomial</a> distribution class with the following parameters: total_count = 8 (number of trials or meetings), probs = {0.6, 0.7,0 .8, 0.9}, for our range of estimates about the probability of the Fed raising the federal funds rate by 0.25% at each meeting.</p>\\n\\n<pre>\\n# First we encode our assumptions.\\nnum_times_fed_meets_per_year = 8.\\npossible_fed_increases = tf.range(\\nstart=0.,\\nlimit=num_times_fed_meets_per_year + 1)\\npossible_cc_interest_rates = 2. + 10. + 0.25 * possible_fed_increases \\nprob_fed_raises_rates = tf.constant([0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9])</pre>\\n\\n<pre>\\n# Now we use TFP to compute probabilities in a vectorized manner.\\n# Pad a dim so we broadcast fed probs against CC interest rates.\\nprob_fed_raises_rates = prob_fed_raises_rates[…, tf.newaxis]\\nprob_cc_interest_rate = <strong>tfd.Binomial</strong>(\\ntotal_count=num_times_fed_meets_per_year,\\nprobs=prob_fed_raises_rates).prob(possible_fed_increases)</pre>\\n\\n<p>In the graphs below, notice how the probability distribution for your credit card rate in 12 months depends critically on your estimate about the probability of the Fed raising rates at each of the eight meetings. You can see that for every increase of 0.1 in your estimate of the Fed raising rates at each meeting, the expected interest rate for your credit card in 12 months increases by about 0.2%.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6eQin\"><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*7gRb9Q0cnU8NpnDH\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Image by Josh Dillion and Deepak Kanungo. Used with permission.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n<p>Even if all market participants used the binomial distribution in their models, it’s easy to see how they could disagree about the future prime rate because of the differences in their estimate for probs. Indeed, this parameter is hard to estimate. Many institutions have dedicated analysts, including previous employees of the Fed, analyzing the Fed’s every document, speech, and event to try to estimate this parameter.</p>\\n<p>Recall that we assumed this parameter probs was constant in our model for each of the next eight Fed meetings. How realistic is that? Members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the rate setting body, are not just a set of biased coins. They can and do change their individual biases based on how the economy changes over time. The assumption that the parameter probs will be constant over the next 12 months is not only unrealistic, but also risky.</p>\\n<p><strong>3. Errors from the failure of a model to adapt to structural changes:</strong> The underlying data-generating stochastic process may vary over time—i.e., the process is not stationary ergodic. We live in a dynamic capitalist economy characterized by technological innovations and changing monetary and fiscal policies. Time-variant distributions for asset values and risks are the rule, not the exception. For such distributions, parameter values based on historical data are bound to introduce errors into forecasts.</p>\\n<p>In our example above, if the economy were to show signs of slowing down, the Fed might decide to adopt a more neutral stance in its fourth meeting, making you change your probs parameter from 70% to 50% going forward. This change in your probs parameter will in turn change the forecast of your credit card interest rate.</p>\\n<p>Sometimes the time-variant distributions and their parameters change continuously or abruptly, as in the Mexican Peso Crisis. For either continuous or abrupt changes, the models used will need to adapt to evolving market conditions. A new functional form with different parameters might be required to explain and predict asset values and risks in the new regime.</p>\\n<p>Suppose after the fifth meeting in our example, the U.S. economy is hit by an external shock—say a new populist government in Greece decides to default on its debt obligations. Now the Fed may be more likely to cut interest rates than to raise them. Given this structural change in the Fed’s outlook, we will have to change the binomial probability distribution in our model to a trinomial distribution with appropriate parameters.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\\n<p>Finance is not a precise predictive science like physics. Not even close. So, let’s not treat academic theories and models of finance as if they were models of quantum physics.</p>\\n<p>All financial models, whether based on academic theories or data mining strategies, are at the mercy of the trinity of modeling errors. While this trifecta of errors can be mitigated with appropriate modeling tools, it cannot be eliminated. There will always be asymmetry of information and cognitive biases. Models of asset values and risks will change over time due to the dynamic nature of capitalism, human behavior, and technological innovation.</p>\\n<p>Financial models need a framework that quantifies the uncertainty inherent in predictions of time-variant stochastic processes. Equally importantly, the framework needs to continually update the model or its parameters—or both—based on materially new data sets. Such models will have to be trained using small data sets, since the underlying environment may have changed too quickly to collect a sizable amount of relevant data.</p>\\n\\n<h3>Acknowledgements</h3>\\n<p>We thank the TensorFlow Probability team, especially <a href=\"http://twitter.com/mikeshwe\">Mike Shwe</a> and Josh Dillon, for their help in earlier drafts of this blog post.</p>\\n<h3>References</h3>\\n<ol>\\n<li>\\n<em><a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-money-formula/9781119358619/\">The Money Formula</a></em>, by David Orrell and Paul Wilmott, Wiley, 2017</li>\\n<li>\\n<em><a href=\"http://www.stat.rice.edu/~thomp/papers/nobelsfornonsens.pdf\">Nobels For Nonsense</a></em>, by J.R.

In addition to a major infrastructure change, the move to containers also necessitates the adoption of both DevOps processes and culture, affecting the makeup of IT departments.</p>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/9-trends-to-watch-in-systems-engineering-and-operations\\'>9 trends to watch in systems engineering and operations.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/y8IhOgGCeoU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>', 'links': [{'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/y8IhOgGCeoU/9-trends-to-watch-in-systems-engineering-and-operations', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Nikki McDonald, John Devins'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Nikki McDonald, John Devins'}, 'author': 'Nikki McDonald, John Devins', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/9-trends-to-watch-in-systems-engineering-and-operations'}, {'title': 'Four short links: 21 January 2019', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Four short links: 21 January 2019'}, 'updated': '2019-01-21T13:05:00Z', 'updated_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=21, tm_hour=13, tm_min=5, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=21, tm_isdst=0), 'id': 'tag:www.oreilly.com,2019-01-21:/ideas/four-short-links-21-january-2019', 'guidislink': True, 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/yiSFH4H0aQM/four-short-links-21-january-2019', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': '<p><em>Programming Spreadsheets, Star Emulator, AI for Social Good, Participatory Democracy</em></p><ol>\\r\\n<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/influencing-mainstream-software-applying-programming-language-research-ideas-to-transform-spreadsheets/\">Applying Programming Language Research Ideas to Transform Spreadsheets</a> (Microsoft) -- <i>an Excel cell can now contain a first-class record, linked to external data sources.

Competition among languages has led to improvements across the board. Established players like Java have added major features, while upstart languages like Go and Rust look to improve packaging and exception handling to add “fit and finish” to their ecosystems. As we enter 2019, we asked some of our O’Reilly authors and training course instructors for their thoughts on what’s in store for established players and fast-growing languages.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Python</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Python\\'s incredible growth over the past decade shows no signs of slowing. In addition to maintaining its position as the most popular introductory language for students, scientists, and knowledge workers, Python will continue its widespread adoption in web development, DevOps, data analysis, and machine learning circles. Matt Harrison, who runs the Python and data science training and consulting company MetaSnake (and is <a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/search/?query=matt%20harrison&amp;extended_publisher_data=true&amp;highlight=true&amp;is_academic_institution_account=false&amp;source=user&amp;include_assessments=false&amp;include_case_studies=true&amp;include_courses=true&amp;include_orioles=true&amp;include_playlists=true&amp;formats=live%20online%20training&amp;publishers=O%27Reilly%20Media%2C%20Inc.&amp;sort=date_added\">a frequent instructor of Python courses on the O\\'Reilly online learning platform</a>), offers his take:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Python has traditionally been more focused on small data, but I think that as other tools that enable big data—such as Dask and flexible Python solutions on top of Kubernetes—continue to improve, we will see Python dominate in big data as well. I’m continuing to see large companies that have traditionally used Java or proprietary languages replacing those with Python.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In 2019, the Python community will cohere around Python 3, as <a href=\"https://pythonclock.org/\">maintenance for Python 2 will end on January 1, 2020</a>. And it will do so under a new governance model, as Guido van Rossum, the creator of the language, stepped down as \"benevolent dictator for life\" in July 2018. After months of debate, the community recently voted to go forward under a <a href=\"https://discuss.python.org/t/python-governance-vote-december-2018-results/546\">steering council model</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Java</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The release of Java 11 in September introduced major new features, such as nest-based access controls, which eliminate the need for compilers to insert bridge methods; dynamic class-file constraints; the new HttpClient, which removes the need for an external dependency when writing applications to communicate with web services; and the adoption of the Unicode 10 standard for localization. As Ben Evans, coauthor of <a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/optimizing-java/9781492039259/\"><em>Optimizing Java</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/java-in-a/9781449371296/\"><em>Java in a Nutshell</em></a>, explains: \"Java has adapted well to new frontiers such as cloud and microservices. Java 8 had problems with microservice startup times, but Java 11 solves that problem. It\\'s a much better environment for developing new microservice applications from scratch.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Looking ahead to future versions of Java, Evans says that bringing value types to Java is a major current project. Value types are intended to be a third form of data type (to complement the existing primitive types and object references), which Evans sees as one way to future-proof the JVM, calling it one of the major changes to the language that \"will change the character of Java development in fundamental ways.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Go</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Go team is working on a prototype command called <code>vgo</code>. Currently, when you install third-party libraries with the <code>go get</code> tool, the latest available version of a package is retrieved, even if it includes incompatibilities that can break your code. The <code>vgo</code> tool will “help you manage the versions of the various packages your app requires, without introducing conflicts,” explains Jay McGavren, author of the forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/head-first-go/9781491969540/\"><em>Head First Go</em></a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The late 2018 release of Go 1.11 provided experimental support for compiling Go to WebAssembly, a binary format for code that can run in a web browser. “This promises to be faster and more efficient than JavaScript,” McGavren says. “And it’s supported by all the major browsers.

Competition among languages has led to improvements across the board. Established players like Java have added major features, while upstart languages like Go and Rust look to improve packaging and exception handling to add “fit and finish” to their ecosystems. As we enter 2019, we asked some of our O’Reilly authors and training course instructors for their thoughts on what’s in store for established players and fast-growing languages.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Python</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Python\\'s incredible growth over the past decade shows no signs of slowing. In addition to maintaining its position as the most popular introductory language for students, scientists, and knowledge workers, Python will continue its widespread adoption in web development, DevOps, data analysis, and machine learning circles. Matt Harrison, who runs the Python and data science training and consulting company MetaSnake (and is <a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/search/?query=matt%20harrison&amp;extended_publisher_data=true&amp;highlight=true&amp;is_academic_institution_account=false&amp;source=user&amp;include_assessments=false&amp;include_case_studies=true&amp;include_courses=true&amp;include_orioles=true&amp;include_playlists=true&amp;formats=live%20online%20training&amp;publishers=O%27Reilly%20Media%2C%20Inc.&amp;sort=date_added\">a frequent instructor of Python courses on the O\\'Reilly online learning platform</a>), offers his take:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<blockquote>\\r\\n<p>Python has traditionally been more focused on small data, but I think that as other tools that enable big data—such as Dask and flexible Python solutions on top of Kubernetes—continue to improve, we will see Python dominate in big data as well. I’m continuing to see large companies that have traditionally used Java or proprietary languages replacing those with Python.</p>\\r\\n</blockquote>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In 2019, the Python community will cohere around Python 3, as <a href=\"https://pythonclock.org/\">maintenance for Python 2 will end on January 1, 2020</a>. And it will do so under a new governance model, as Guido van Rossum, the creator of the language, stepped down as \"benevolent dictator for life\" in July 2018. After months of debate, the community recently voted to go forward under a <a href=\"https://discuss.python.org/t/python-governance-vote-december-2018-results/546\">steering council model</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Java</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The release of Java 11 in September introduced major new features, such as nest-based access controls, which eliminate the need for compilers to insert bridge methods; dynamic class-file constraints; the new HttpClient, which removes the need for an external dependency when writing applications to communicate with web services; and the adoption of the Unicode 10 standard for localization. As Ben Evans, coauthor of <a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/optimizing-java/9781492039259/\"><em>Optimizing Java</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/java-in-a/9781449371296/\"><em>Java in a Nutshell</em></a>, explains: \"Java has adapted well to new frontiers such as cloud and microservices. Java 8 had problems with microservice startup times, but Java 11 solves that problem. It\\'s a much better environment for developing new microservice applications from scratch.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Looking ahead to future versions of Java, Evans says that bringing value types to Java is a major current project. Value types are intended to be a third form of data type (to complement the existing primitive types and object references), which Evans sees as one way to future-proof the JVM, calling it one of the major changes to the language that \"will change the character of Java development in fundamental ways.\"</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Go</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Go team is working on a prototype command called <code>vgo</code>. Currently, when you install third-party libraries with the <code>go get</code> tool, the latest available version of a package is retrieved, even if it includes incompatibilities that can break your code. The <code>vgo</code> tool will “help you manage the versions of the various packages your app requires, without introducing conflicts,” explains Jay McGavren, author of the forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/head-first-go/9781491969540/\"><em>Head First Go</em></a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The late 2018 release of Go 1.11 provided experimental support for compiling Go to WebAssembly, a binary format for code that can run in a web browser. “This promises to be faster and more efficient than JavaScript,” McGavren says. “And it’s supported by all the major browsers.

Current AI and machine learning technologies require large amounts of data, so it makes sense for companies to investigate use cases in areas where they have existing data applications. This is precisely what we found in our upcoming survey, “Artificial Intelligence in the Enterprise”: for example, respondents from the financial services sector were already using AI in “customer service” or “finance and accounting.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-RN4iK\"><img alt=\"what parts of the company use AI projects\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure2-08702f5d7dd3d7c663e7251f85b6b29f.png\"></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s also no surprise that even though deep learning is often associated with computer vision and speech technologies, we are beginning to see it used in areas where companies already have existing data sets and machine learning applications (specifically areas that involve text and time series).

At the Artificial Intelligence Conference, we’ll have sessions and case studies from many industries, including:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/stopic/3013\">Financial Services</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/stopic/3019\">Media, Marketing, Advertising</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/stopic/3020\">Health and Medicine</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/stopic/3022\">Retail and e-commerce</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>The skills gap and lack of data</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As I noted, respondents who work at organizations with more mature AI practices cited “data” and “lack of people” as the primary challenges they face as they attempt to adopt more AI technologies. When it comes to data, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/assessing-progress-in-automation-technologies\">there are new tools</a> designed to help companies overcome lack of data, including tools for generating synthetic data, simulation environments, and automation technologies designed to supercharge human labelers (<a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/groundtruth/\">Amazon Ground Truth</a> is the most recent example).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In our upcoming survey, “Artificial Intelligence in the Enterprise,” we found companies at different stages of AI adoption are in need of talent across many skill sets. In particular, the need for skilled data and infrastructure engineers is the same across maturity levels:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-5bMiM\"><img alt=\"ai skills gaps\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure3-80720e5ebe1c55574b9d577f3df75704.png\"></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Improvements in tools have made AI more accessible for non-experts. Many machine learning libraries are open source, and many cutting-edge models (found in research papers) eventually get implemented in these libraries. In our <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/how-companies-are-putting-aI-to-work-through-deep-learning.csp\">previous survey</a>, we found the top three deep learning tools to be TensorFlow (at the time, used by 61% of all respondents), Keras (25%), and PyTorch (20%). This year, we found a higher rate of usage for Keras (34%) and PyTorch (29%). We also are seeing improvements in tools for reinforcement learning: the most recent version of <a href=\"https://github.com/ray-project/ray\">Ray</a> now <a href=\"https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/blog/scaling-multi-agent-rl-with-rllib\">supports multi-agent reinforcement learning</a> at large scale.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But AI requires a suite of technologies that go beyond machine learning libraries. To this end, companies are beginning to build or buy tools that can support and sustain their teams of data scientists and suites of AI applications. Leading companies will present some of their internal tools and platforms at the Artificial Intelligence Conference in April:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/stopic/3009\">Deep Learning and Machine Learning tools</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/stopic/3016\">Platforms and infrastructure</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/stopic/3008\">Models and Methods</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/stopic/3010\">Reinforcement Learning</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/stopic/3025\">Data and Data Networks</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/detail/73785\">“Open source tools for machine learning models and data sets versioning”</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Responsible AI</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In parallel with the progress in AI research and the progress in tools for building AI applications, there has been strong awareness around issues that go beyond simply optimizing business or quantitative metrics. This includes such topics as ethics, privacy and security, fairness, reliability and safety, and the economic impact of automation technologies. The community is beginning to come up with concrete strategies and best practices to address many of these concerns.

In particular, the need for skilled data and infrastructure engineers is the same across maturity levels:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-5bMiM\"><img alt=\"ai skills gaps\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure3-80720e5ebe1c55574b9d577f3df75704.png\"></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Improvements in tools have made AI more accessible for non-experts. Many machine learning libraries are open source, and many cutting-edge models (found in research papers) eventually get implemented in these libraries. In our <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/how-companies-are-putting-aI-to-work-through-deep-learning.csp\">previous survey</a>, we found the top three deep learning tools to be TensorFlow (at the time, used by 61% of all respondents), Keras (25%), and PyTorch (20%). This year, we found a higher rate of usage for Keras (34%) and PyTorch (29%). We also are seeing improvements in tools for reinforcement learning: the most recent version of <a href=\"https://github.com/ray-project/ray\">Ray</a> now <a href=\"https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/blog/scaling-multi-agent-rl-with-rllib\">supports multi-agent reinforcement learning</a> at large scale.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But AI requires a suite of technologies that go beyond machine learning libraries. To this end, companies are beginning to build or buy tools that can support and sustain their teams of data scientists and suites of AI applications. Leading companies will present some of their internal tools and platforms at the Artificial Intelligence Conference in April:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/stopic/3009\">Deep Learning and Machine Learning tools</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/stopic/3016\">Platforms and infrastructure</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/stopic/3008\">Models and Methods</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/stopic/3010\">Reinforcement Learning</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/stopic/3025\">Data and Data Networks</a></li>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/detail/73785\">“Open source tools for machine learning models and data sets versioning”</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Responsible AI</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In parallel with the progress in AI research and the progress in tools for building AI applications, there has been strong awareness around issues that go beyond simply optimizing business or quantitative metrics. This includes such topics as ethics, privacy and security, fairness, reliability and safety, and the economic impact of automation technologies. The community is beginning to come up with concrete strategies and best practices to address many of these concerns. For example, <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/detail/73864\">one of the sessions</a> at the conference will provide a technical overview for a <a href=\"https://ai.google/education/responsible-ai-practices\">framework for Responsible AI</a> used within Google. Additionally, there will be many other practical sessions at the Artificial Intelligence Conference from practitioners who are working at the forefront of designing AI applications that can overcome many of these important considerations:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ny/public/schedule/stopic/3012\">Ethics,

While full automation might still be a ways off, there are many workflows and tasks that lend themselves to partial automation. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation\">McKinsey estimates</a> that “fewer than 5% of occupations can be entirely automated using current technology. However, about 60% of occupations could have 30% or more of their constituent activities automated.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We have already seen some interesting products and services that rely on computer vision and speech technologies, and we expect to see even more in 2019. Look for additional improvements in language models and robotics that will result in solutions that target text and physical tasks. Rather than waiting for a complete automation model, competition will drive organizations to implement partial automation solutions—and the success of those partial automation projects will spur further development.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>AI in the enterprise will build upon existing analytic applications.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Companies have spent the last few years building processes and infrastructure to unlock disparate data sources in order to improve analytics on their most mission-critical analysis, whether it is business analytics, recommenders and personalization, forecasting, or anomaly detection and monitoring.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Aside from new systems that use vision and speech technologies, we expect early forays into deep learning and reinforcement learning will be in areas where companies already have data and machine learning in place. For example, companies are infusing their systems for temporal and geospatial data with deep learning, resulting in scalable and more accurate <em>hybrid </em>systems (i.e., systems that combine deep learning with other machine learning methods).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>In an age of partial automation and human-in-the-loop solutions, UX/UI design will be critical.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Many current AI solutions work hand in hand with consumers, human workers, and domain experts. These systems improve the productivity of users and in many cases enable them to perform tasks at incredible scale and accuracy. Proper UX/UI design not only streamlines those tasks but also goes a long way toward getting users to trust and use AI solutions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>We will see specialized hardware for sensing, model training, and model inference.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The resurgence in deep learning began around 2011 with record-setting models in speech and computer vision. Today, there is certainly enough scale to justify specialized hardware—Facebook alone makes trillions of predictions per day. Google, too, has had enough scale to justify producing its own specialized hardware: it has been using its tensor processing units (TPUs) in its cloud since last year. 2019 should see a broader selection of specialized hardware begin to appear. Numerous companies and startups in China and the US have been working on hardware that targets model building and inference, both in the data center and on edge devices.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>AI solutions will continue to rely on hybrid models.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While deep learning continues to drive a lot of interesting research, most end-to-end solutions <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/building-tools-for-the-ai-applications-of-tomorrow\">are hybrid systems</a>. In 2019, we’ll begin to hear more about the essential role of other components and methods—including model-based methods like Bayesian inference, tree search, evolution, knowledge graphs, simulation platforms, and many more. And we just might begin to see exciting developments in machine learning methods that aren’t based on neural networks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>AI successes will spur investments in new tools and processes.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We are in a highly empirical era for machine learning. Tools for ML development will need to account for the importance of data, experimentation and model search, and model deployment and monitoring. Take just one step of the process: model building. Companies are beginning to look into tools for data lineage, metadata management and analysis, efficient utilization of compute resources, efficient model search, and hyperparameter tuning. In 2019, expect many new tools to ease the development and actual deployment of AI and Ml to products and services.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Machine deception will remain a serious challenge.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In spite of a barrage of “fake” news, we’re still in the early days of machine-generated content (fake images, video, audio, and text). At least for now, detection and forensic technologies have been able to ferret out fake video and images. But the tools for generating fake content are improving quickly, so <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/program/media-forensics\">funding agencies in the US</a> and elsewhere have initiated programs to make sure detection technologies keep up.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>And machine deception does not just refer to machines deceiving humans; machines deceiving machines (bots) and people deceiving machines (troll armies and click farms) can be just as difficult to deal with. Information propagation methods and click farms will continue to be used to fool ranking systems on content and retail platforms, and methods to detect and combat this will have to be developed as fast as new forms of machine deception are launched.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Reliability and safety will take center stage.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s been heartening to see researchers and practitioners become seriously interested and engaged in issues pertaining to <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-collection-and-data-markets-in-the-age-of-privacy-and-machine-learning?twitter=@bigdata\">privacy, fairness, and ethics</a>. But as AI systems become deployed in mission-critical applications—and even life and death scenarios involving applications such as autonomous vehicles or healthcare—improved efficiency from automation will need to come with safety and reliability measurements and guarantees. The rise of machine deception in online platforms, as well as recent accidents involving autonomous vehicles, has cracked this issue wide open. In 2019, expect to hear safety discussed more intensively.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Democratizing access to large training data will level the playing field.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Because many of the models we rely on—including deep learning and reinforcement learning— are data hungry, the anticipated winners in the field of AI have been huge companies or countries with access to massive amounts of data. But services for generating labeled datasets (specifically companies that rely on human labelers) are beginning to use machine learning tools to help their human workers scale and improve their accuracy.

While full automation might still be a ways off, there are many workflows and tasks that lend themselves to partial automation. In fact, <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/digital-mckinsey/our-insights/four-fundamentals-of-workplace-automation\">McKinsey estimates</a> that “fewer than 5% of occupations can be entirely automated using current technology. However, about 60% of occupations could have 30% or more of their constituent activities automated.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We have already seen some interesting products and services that rely on computer vision and speech technologies, and we expect to see even more in 2019. Look for additional improvements in language models and robotics that will result in solutions that target text and physical tasks. Rather than waiting for a complete automation model, competition will drive organizations to implement partial automation solutions—and the success of those partial automation projects will spur further development.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>AI in the enterprise will build upon existing analytic applications.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Companies have spent the last few years building processes and infrastructure to unlock disparate data sources in order to improve analytics on their most mission-critical analysis, whether it is business analytics, recommenders and personalization, forecasting, or anomaly detection and monitoring.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Aside from new systems that use vision and speech technologies, we expect early forays into deep learning and reinforcement learning will be in areas where companies already have data and machine learning in place. For example, companies are infusing their systems for temporal and geospatial data with deep learning, resulting in scalable and more accurate <em>hybrid </em>systems (i.e., systems that combine deep learning with other machine learning methods).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>In an age of partial automation and human-in-the-loop solutions, UX/UI design will be critical.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Many current AI solutions work hand in hand with consumers, human workers, and domain experts. These systems improve the productivity of users and in many cases enable them to perform tasks at incredible scale and accuracy. Proper UX/UI design not only streamlines those tasks but also goes a long way toward getting users to trust and use AI solutions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>We will see specialized hardware for sensing, model training, and model inference.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The resurgence in deep learning began around 2011 with record-setting models in speech and computer vision. Today, there is certainly enough scale to justify specialized hardware—Facebook alone makes trillions of predictions per day. Google, too, has had enough scale to justify producing its own specialized hardware: it has been using its tensor processing units (TPUs) in its cloud since last year. 2019 should see a broader selection of specialized hardware begin to appear. Numerous companies and startups in China and the US have been working on hardware that targets model building and inference, both in the data center and on edge devices.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>AI solutions will continue to rely on hybrid models.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While deep learning continues to drive a lot of interesting research, most end-to-end solutions <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/building-tools-for-the-ai-applications-of-tomorrow\">are hybrid systems</a>. In 2019, we’ll begin to hear more about the essential role of other components and methods—including model-based methods like Bayesian inference, tree search, evolution, knowledge graphs, simulation platforms, and many more. And we just might begin to see exciting developments in machine learning methods that aren’t based on neural networks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>AI successes will spur investments in new tools and processes.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We are in a highly empirical era for machine learning. Tools for ML development will need to account for the importance of data, experimentation and model search, and model deployment and monitoring. Take just one step of the process: model building. Companies are beginning to look into tools for data lineage, metadata management and analysis, efficient utilization of compute resources, efficient model search, and hyperparameter tuning. In 2019, expect many new tools to ease the development and actual deployment of AI and Ml to products and services.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Machine deception will remain a serious challenge.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In spite of a barrage of “fake” news, we’re still in the early days of machine-generated content (fake images, video, audio, and text). At least for now, detection and forensic technologies have been able to ferret out fake video and images. But the tools for generating fake content are improving quickly, so <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/program/media-forensics\">funding agencies in the US</a> and elsewhere have initiated programs to make sure detection technologies keep up.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>And machine deception does not just refer to machines deceiving humans; machines deceiving machines (bots) and people deceiving machines (troll armies and click farms) can be just as difficult to deal with. Information propagation methods and click farms will continue to be used to fool ranking systems on content and retail platforms, and methods to detect and combat this will have to be developed as fast as new forms of machine deception are launched.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Reliability and safety will take center stage.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s been heartening to see researchers and practitioners become seriously interested and engaged in issues pertaining to <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-collection-and-data-markets-in-the-age-of-privacy-and-machine-learning?twitter=@bigdata\">privacy, fairness, and ethics</a>. But as AI systems become deployed in mission-critical applications—and even life and death scenarios involving applications such as autonomous vehicles or healthcare—improved efficiency from automation will need to come with safety and reliability measurements and guarantees. The rise of machine deception in online platforms, as well as recent accidents involving autonomous vehicles, has cracked this issue wide open. In 2019, expect to hear safety discussed more intensively.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Democratizing access to large training data will level the playing field.</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Because many of the models we rely on—including deep learning and reinforcement learning— are data hungry, the anticipated winners in the field of AI have been huge companies or countries with access to massive amounts of data. But services for generating labeled datasets (specifically companies that rely on human labelers) are beginning to use machine learning tools to help their human workers scale and improve their accuracy. And in certain domains, new tools like generative adversarial networks (GAN) and simulation platforms are able to provide realistic synthetic data, which can be used to train machine learning models. Finally, a new crop of secure and privacy-preserving technologies that facilitate sharing of data across organizations are helping companies take advantage of data they didn’t generate. Together, these developments will help smaller organizations compete using machine learning and AI.</p>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/9-ai-trends-on-our-radar\\'>9 AI trends on our radar.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/OMlYUCpJ-9s\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>', 'links': [{'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/OMlYUCpJ-9s/9-ai-trends-on-our-radar', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Ben Lorica'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Ben Lorica'}, 'author': 'Ben Lorica', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/9-ai-trends-on-our-radar'}, {'title': 'Four short links: 14 January 2019', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Four short links: 14 January 2019'}, 'updated': '2019-01-14T12:50:00Z', 'updated_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=1, tm_mday=14, tm_hour=12, tm_min=50, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=14, tm_isdst=0), 'id': 'tag:www.oreilly.com,2019-01-14:/ideas/four-short-links-14-january-2019', 'guidislink': True, 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/bF-kKokjN3A/four-short-links-14-january-2019', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': '<p><em>Software Patents, Learning Artistic Styles, Decentralized Commerce, and Open Source Notes Software</em></p><ol>\\r\\n<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2019/01/10/federal-troll-circuit.html\">Software Patents Slipping Back</a> (BoingBoing) -- USPTO issuing new guidance that re-enables crappy software patenting.</li>\\r\\n<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01802131v2/document\">Unsupervised Learning of Artistic Styles with Archetypal Style Analysis</a> -- <i>Our objective is to automatically discover, summarize, and manipulate artistic styles present in the collection.</i> (via <a href=\"https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/01/11/unsupervised-learning-of-artistic-styles-with-archetypal-style-analysis/\">Adrian Colyer</a>)</li>\\r\\n<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://opaque.link/post/dropgang/\">Dropgangs, or the Future of Darknet Markets</a> -- <i>The other major change is the use of “dead drops” instead of the postal system, which has proven vulnerable to tracking and interception.

Tim O\\'Reilly explores the areas poised for sudden shifts. </em></p><p>There’s a passage in Ernest Hemingway’s novel <em>The Sun Also Rises</em> in which a character named Mike is asked how he went bankrupt. “Two ways,” he answers. “Gradually, then suddenly.”</p>\\n\\n<p>Technological change happens much the same way. Small changes accumulate, and suddenly the world is a different place. Throughout my career at O’Reilly Media, we’ve tracked and fostered a lot of “gradually, then suddenly” movements: the World Wide Web, open source software, big data, cloud computing, sensors and ubiquitous computing, and now the pervasive effects of AI and algorithmic systems on society and the economy.</p>\\n\\n<p>What are some of the things that are in the middle of their “gradually, then suddenly” transition right now? The list is long; here are a few of the areas that are on my mind.</p>\\n\\n<h2>AI and algorithms are everywhere</h2>\\n\\n<p>The most important trend for readers to focus on is the development of new kinds of partnership between human and machine.

Gradually, then suddenly, it\\'s becoming <em>“</em>the next factory of the world.” That’s the title of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Next-Factory-World-Investment-Reshaping-ebook/dp/B01MUGYCME\">a 2017 book by McKinsey’s Irene Sun</a>. There’s also a detailed McKinsey report, <em><a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/middle-east-and-africa/the-closest-look-yet-at-chinese-economic-engagement-in-africa\">Dance of the Lions and Dragons</a></em>, based on a study of more than 1,000 Chinese-owned factories in Africa. As the US has withdrawn into a kind of neo-isolationism, China is stepping up.

Expect to wake up one day and realize that China has done to the US what the US did to the UK in the 20th century, becoming the new leader of the world economy, for good or ill. Up until now, China has spent a lot more time copying us than we spend copying them; that’s suddenly going to go into reverse. For a detailed look at the competition between the two “AI superpowers,” read <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/AI-Superpowers-China-Silicon-Valley/dp/132854639X\">Kai-Fu Lee’s book</a> of that name. See trend 1.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The next agricultural revolution</h2>\\n\\n<p>Last year, when I spoke at the <a href=\"https://foodtechconnect.com/events/\">Food+Tech Connect Conference</a> in Amsterdam, I got an eyeful of the agricultural revolution that is happening in the Netherlands. Did you know that this tiny country, 1/270th the size of the US, is <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/09/holland-agriculture-sustainable-farming/\">the world’s second-largest food exporter</a>? That’s a testament to the way that precision farming and other new technologies are transforming agriculture. Silicon Valley is waking up to the opportunity, and so are consumers. I stopped in at an Oakland sports bar recently, and what did I see on the menu but an <a href=\"https://impossiblefoods.com/food/\">Impossible Burger</a>. This new meatless meat is no longer just a treat for tech elites. Expect meaningful change in the makeup of our food supply, what we consume, and how it gets to us. If you’re skeptical, remember that 25 years ago, the internet was just becoming mainstream, and even the smartphone revolution is only 10 years old. Gradually, then suddenly, both have transformed the world.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Climate change</h2>\\n\\n<p>You have to have huge ideological blinders on not to see that the effects of climate change are less and less “gradual” and that we are rushing headlong toward a “suddenly” moment. One of the most interesting discoveries for me in the past year has been the work of groups like <a href=\"https://sohp.fas.harvard.edu\">the Initiative for the Science of the Human Past at Harvard</a>, which have been looking at the connection between climate change events and the fall of ancient civilizations. My friend <a href=\"http://www.malcolmwiener.net\">Malcolm Wiener</a> pointed out to me that climate events trigger mass migrations, which often bring with them new plagues, and whether a civilization survives (<a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/titles/11079.html\">as the Roman Empire did, albeit on a reduced scale</a>) or falls depends on the quality of its ruling elites. I leave you to consider the implications of the current political moment.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Genetic engineering</h2>\\n\\n<p>Genetic engineering is an important driver of food innovation, but it’s also a huge part of the possible response to climate change. <a href=\"https://reviverestore.org/projects/woolly-mammoth/\">Bring the wooly mammoth back to life</a>? <a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2018/04/crispr-used-to-genetically-edit-coral.html\">Save coral reefs</a>?

And don’t get me started on the application of genomics to healthcare. Back in 2010, George Church pointed out the equivalent of <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/417628/a-moores-law-for-genetics/\">Moore’s law for gene sequencing</a>. As a result of that acceleration, we’re now approaching the “suddenly” moment for precision medicine.

Their demo involves someone playing the old <em>Asteroids</em> computer game without touching a keyboard, using machine learning to interpret the nerve signals that are sent to the hands. But it isn’t quite what you think. Moving things in the digital realm without moving your hands seems startling enough (though it’s worth remembering that it was once considered remarkable to be able to read silently without moving your lips). But that’s just the first stage. Essentially, users of this technology “grow” another virtual hand, which they can move independently of their physical hands. One of the researchers bowled me over when he said he was “working on controlling nine cursors at once.” Gradually, then suddenly, our children will interface with machines in deeper and deeper ways. Humanity is already going cyborg (see trend 1); expect it to accelerate. Don’t fall into the trap of thinking that AI will replace humans when it can be used even more powerfully to augment them.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Online learning</h2>\\n\\n<p>Online learning isn’t just about online schools like Udacity and Coursera or <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/index.html\">O’Reilly’s own learning platform</a>. What’s too often overlooked is how education and cognitive augmentation go hand in hand. The reason Uber and Lyft have a seemingly unlimited supply of drivers is because no training is required; the app itself does the heavy lifting of telling the driver where to pick up the passenger and how to get to the destination. At O’Reilly, we call this “<a href=\"https://trainingindustry.com/articles/content-development/the-next-big-shift-in-enterprise-learning-performance-adjacent-learning\">performance-adjacent learning</a>.” Josh Bersin calls it “<a href=\"https://joshbersin.com/2018/06/a-new-paradigm-for-corporate-training-learning-in-the-flow-of-work/\">learning in the flow of work</a>.” So many of the attempts to create online education seem to be reproducing 20th century models online; instead, we’ve hitched our platform squarely to the “gradually, then suddenly” trend of knowledge on demand, understanding that the supporting role of coursework is to get you to the point where you can take in and use on-demand knowledge. (We call this “structural literacy.”) See trend 1.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The crisis of faith in government</h2>\\n\\n<p>Ever since Jennifer Pahlka and I began working on the Gov 2.0 Summit back in 2008, we’ve been concerned that if we can’t get government up to speed on 21st century technology, a critical pillar of the good society will crumble. When we started that effort, we were focused primarily on government innovation; over time, through Jen’s work at <a href=\"https://www.codeforamerica.org/\">Code for America</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.usds.gov/\">United States Digital Service</a>, that shifted to a focus on making sure that government services actually work for those who need them most. Michael Lewis\\' latest book, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fifth-Risk-Michael-Lewis/dp/1324002646\">The Fifth Risk</a></em>, highlights just how bad things might get if we continue to neglect and undermine the machinery of government. It’s not just the political fracturing of our country that should concern us; it’s the fact that government plays a critical role in infrastructure, in innovation, and in the safety net. That role has gradually been eroded, and the cracks that are appearing in the foundation of our society are coming at the worst possible time.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Deeper reading</h2>\\n\\n<p>Economics is my learning frontier right now as I explore the connections between the business ecosystems of the great tech platforms and trends in what I’ve been calling the Next Economy.

That final book is not at all what most people will expect from the title. It\\'s not about the “invisible hand” or <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> but about Adam Smith’s other great book, <em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em>, which explores the role of social norms as a check on self-interest.

But the council cannot change the governance PEP; that can only happen via a two-thirds vote of the core team.</i> Python gets a constitution (aka <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-8016/\">PEP 8016</a>).</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/four-short-links-20-december-2018\\'>Four short links: 20 December 2018.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/E7CLWSAp7H8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>', 'links': [{'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/E7CLWSAp7H8/four-short-links-20-december-2018', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Nat Torkington'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Nat Torkington'}, 'author': 'Nat Torkington', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/four-short-links-20-december-2018'}, {'title': 'What is neural architecture search?', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'What is neural architecture search?'}, 'updated': '2018-12-20T12:00:00Z', 'updated_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2018, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=20, tm_hour=12, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=354, tm_isdst=0), 'id': 'tag:www.oreilly.com,2018-12-20:/ideas/what-is-neural-architecture-search', 'guidislink': True, 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/Tz2ZNeTeXP4/what-is-neural-architecture-search', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': '<p><img src=\\'https://d3ucjech6zwjp8.cloudfront.net/600x450/neurons-582050_1920_crop-627194068bc0df7a644359ff60cb180e.jpg\\'/></p><p><em>An overview of NAS and a discussion on how it compares to hyperparameter optimization.</em></p><p>Deep learning offers the promise of bypassing the process of manual feature engineering by learning representations in conjunction with statistical models in an end-to-end fashion. However, neural network architectures themselves are typically designed by experts in a painstaking, ad hoc fashion. Neural architecture search (NAS) has been touted as the path forward for alleviating this pain by automatically identifying architectures that are superior to hand-designed ones.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But with the field moving so fast both in terms of research progress and hype, it can be hard to get answers to basic questions: What exactly is NAS and is it fundamentally different from AutoML or hyperparameter optimization? Do specialized NAS methods actually work? Aren\\'t they prohibitively expensive to use? Should I be using specialized NAS methods? In this post, we\\'ll answer each of these questions. Our discussion touches upon a few key points:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n  <li>There is a false dichotomy between NAS and traditional hyperparameter optimization; in fact, NAS is a subset of hyperparameter optimization. Moreover, specialized NAS methods are not actually fully automated, as they rely on human-designed architectures as starting points.</li>\\r\\n  <li>While exploring and tuning different neural network architectures is of crucial importance in developing high-quality deep learning applications, in our view specialized NAS methods are not ready for primetime just yet: they introduce significant algorithmic and computational complexities compared to high-quality hyperparameter optimization algorithms (e.g., <a href=\"https://blog.ml.cmu.edu/2018/12/12/massively-parallel-hyperparameter-optimization\">ASHA</a>) without demonstrating improved performance on standard benchmarking tasks.</li>\\r\\n  <li>Specialized NAS methods have nonetheless exhibited remarkable advances in the past few years in terms of improved accuracy, reduced computational costs, and architecture size, and could eventually surpass human performance on neural architecture design.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To set the stage, let\\'s first discuss how NAS fits within the wider umbrella of AutoML (automated machine learning).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>AutoML ⊃ hyperparameter optimization ⊃ NAS</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6nGie\"><img alt=\"NAS, autoML, hyperparameter optimization\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/image1-3250b5283382455a64a9b3fabc39f6c2.jpg\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>Image courtesy of Determined AI.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>AutoML focuses on automating every aspect of the machine learning (ML) workflow to increase efficiency and democratize machine learning so that non-experts can apply machine learning to their problems with ease. While AutoML encompasses the automation of a wide range of problems associated with ETL (extract, transform, load), model training, and model deployment, the problem of hyperparameter optimization is a core focus of AutoML. This problem involves configuring the internal settings that govern the behavior of an ML model/algorithm in order to return a high-quality predictive model.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For example, ridge regression models require setting the value of a regularization term, random forest models require the user to set the maximum tree depth and minimum number of samples per leaf, and training any model with stochastic gradient descent requires setting an appropriate step size. Neural networks also require setting a multitude of hyperparameters, including (1) selecting an optimization method along with its associated set of hyperparameters; (2) setting the dropout rate and other regularization hyperparameters; and, if desired, (3) tuning parameters that control the architecture of the network (e.g., number of hidden layers, number of convolutional filters).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Although the exposition on NAS might suggest it is a completely new problem, our final example above hints at a close relationship between hyperparameter optimization and NAS. While the search spaces used for NAS are generally larger and control different aspects of the neural network architecture, the underlying problem is the same as that addressed by hyperparameter optimization: find a configuration within the search space that performs well on the target task. Hence, we view NAS to be a subproblem within hyperparameter optimization.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>NAS is nonetheless an exciting direction to study, as focusing on a specialized subproblem provides the opportunity to exploit additional structure to design custom tailored solutions, as is done by many specialized NAS approaches. In the next section, we will provide an overview of NAS and delve more into the similarities and differences between hyperparameter optimization and NAS.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>NAS overview</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-RMkiq\"><img alt=\"Neural architecture search (NAS) overview\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/image2-1ab1292fe731b686511b26381162e4d9.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Image courtesy of Determined AI.</figcaption></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Interest in NAS ballooned after the work of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578\">Zoph, et. al., 2016</a> used reinforcement learning to design, at the time, state-of-the-art architectures for image recognition and language modeling. However, Zoph, et. al., 2016, in addition to other first generation specialized approaches for NAS, required a tremendous amount of computational power (e.g., hundreds of GPUs running for thousands (!) of GPU days in aggregate), making them impractical for all but the likes of companies like Google. More recent approaches exploit various methods of reuse to drastically reduce the computational cost, and new methods are being rapidly introduced in the research community.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We\\'ll next dive a bit deeper into the core design decisions associated with all of these specialized NAS methods (for a detailed overview of NAS, we recommend the excellent <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.05377\">survey by Elsken, et al., 2017</a>). The three main components are:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n  <li>\\r\\n<strong>Search space.</strong> This component describes the set of possible neural network architectures to consider. These search spaces are designed specific to the application—e.g., a space of convolutional networks for computer vision tasks or a space of recurrent networks for language modeling tasks. Hence, NAS methods are not fully automated, as the design of these search spaces fundamentally relies on human-designed architectures as starting points. Even so, there are still many architectural decisions remaining. In fact, the number of possible architectures considered in these search spaces are often over 10^10.</li>\\r\\n  <li>\\r\\n<strong>Optimization method.</strong> This component determines how to explore the search space in order to find a good architecture. The most basic approach here is random search, while various adaptive methods have also been introduced—e.g., reinforcement learning, evolutionary search, gradient-based optimization, and Bayesian optimization. While these adaptive approaches differ in how they determine which architectures to evaluate, they all attempt to bias the search toward architectures that are more likely to perform well. Unsurprisingly, all of these methods have counterparts that have been introduced in the context of traditional hyperparameter optimization tasks.</li>\\r\\n  <li>\\r\\n<strong>Evaluation method.</strong> This component measures the quality of each architecture considered by the optimization method. The simplest, but most computationally expensive choice is to fully train an architecture. One can alternatively exploit partial training, similar in spirit to early-stopping methods commonly used in hyperparameter optimization like ASHA. NAS-specific evaluation methods—such as network morphism, weight-sharing, and hypernetworks—have also been introduced to exploit the structure of neural networks to provide cheaper, heuristic estimates of quality. Partial training approaches are typically an order-of-magnitude cheaper than full training, while NAS-specific evaluation methods are two to three orders of magnitude cheaper than full training.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Notably, these are the same three requisite ingredients for traditional hyperparameter optimization methods. The research community has converged on a few canonical benchmarking data sets and tasks to evaluate the performance of different search methods, and we\\'ll next use these benchmarks to report results on head-to-head comparisons between (1) human-designed architectures tuned via hyperparameter optimization methods, and (2) NAS-designed architectures identified via leading specialized NAS methods. (NAS focuses on the problem of <em>identifying</em> architectures, but nonetheless requires a secondary hyperparameter optimization step to tune the non-architecture-specific hyperparameters of the architecture it identifies. Our results show the test error after performing both steps.)</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>NAS models vs. human-designed models</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The two most common tasks used to benchmark NAS methods are (1) designing convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures evaluated on the CIFAR-10 data set, and (2) designing recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures evaluated on the PennTree Bank (PTB) data set.

To be clear, exploring various architectures and performing extensive hyperparameter optimization remain crucial components of any deep learning application workflow. However, in light of the existing research results (as highlighted above), we believe that while specialized NAS methods have demonstrated promising results on these two benchmarks, they are still not ready for prime time for the following reasons:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n  <li>Since highly tuned, manually designed architectures are competitive with computationally tractable NAS methods on CIFAR-10 and outperform specialized NAS methods on PTB, we believe resources are better spent on hyperparameter optimization of existing manually designed architectures.</li>\\r\\n  <li>Most specialized NAS methods are fairly specific to a given search space and need to be retrained or retooled for each new search space. Additionally, certain approaches suffer from robustness issues and can be hard to train.

Although methods that exploit partial training or other NAS-specific evaluation methods require less computation to perform the search (400 GPU days and ~1 GPU day, respectively), they are outperformed by the manually designed architecture in Table 1. Notably, the NAS architectures have nearly an order of magnitude fewer parameters than the human-designed model, indicating promising applications of NAS to memory- and latency-constrained settings.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The test perplexity for different architectures on the PTB data set are shown in Table 2.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<table>\\r\\n  <tbody>\\r\\n    <tr>\\r\\n      <th></th>\\r\\n      <th>Source</th>\\r\\n      <th>Test Perplexity</th>\\r\\n      <th>Search Method</th>\\r\\n      <th>Evaluation Method</th>\\r\\n    </tr>\\r\\n    <tr>\\r\\n      <td>LSTM with MoS</td>\\r\\n      <td><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.03953\">Yang et al., 2017</a></td>\\r\\n      <td>54.4</td>\\r\\n      <td>Human designed</td>\\r\\n      <td>-</td>\\r\\n    </tr>\\r\\n    <tr>\\r\\n      <td>NASNet</td>\\r\\n      <td><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01578\">Zoph et al., 2016</a></td>\\r\\n      <td>62.4</td>\\r\\n      <td>Reinforcement Learning</td>\\r\\n      <td>Full Train</td>\\r\\n    </tr>\\r\\n    <tr>\\r\\n      <td>NAONET</td>\\r\\n      <td><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07233\">Luo et al., 2018</a></td>\\r\\n      <td>56.0</td>\\r\\n      <td>Gradient</td>\\r\\n      <td>Partial Train</td>\\r\\n    </tr>\\r\\n    <tr>\\r\\n      <td>DARTS</td>\\r\\n      <td><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09055\">H.

It is surprising, however, that cheaper evaluation methods outperform full training on this benchmark; this is likely due to the additional advances that have been made in training LSTMs since the publication of Zoph, et.al., 2016.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Are specialized NAS methods ready for widespread adoption?</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Not yet! To be clear, exploring various architectures and performing extensive hyperparameter optimization remain crucial components of any deep learning application workflow. However, in light of the existing research results (as highlighted above), we believe that while specialized NAS methods have demonstrated promising results on these two benchmarks, they are still not ready for prime time for the following reasons:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n  <li>Since highly tuned, manually designed architectures are competitive with computationally tractable NAS methods on CIFAR-10 and outperform specialized NAS methods on PTB, we believe resources are better spent on hyperparameter optimization of existing manually designed architectures.</li>\\r\\n  <li>Most specialized NAS methods are fairly specific to a given search space and need to be retrained or retooled for each new search space. Additionally, certain approaches suffer from robustness issues and can be hard to train. These issues currently hinder the general applicability of existing specialized NAS methods to different tasks.</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Related:</strong></p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n <li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/toward-the-jet-age-of-machine-learning\">\"Toward the Jet Age of machine learning\"</a></li>\\r\\n <li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/neuroevolution-a-different-kind-of-deep-learning\">\"Neuroevolution: A different kind of deep learning\"</a></li>\\r\\n <li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-automation-in-machine-learning\">\"Deep automation in machine learning\"</a></li>\\r\\n <li>Ameet Talwalkar on <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-to-train-and-deploy-deep-learning-at-scale\">\"How to train and deploy deep learning at scale\"</a>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n <li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/open-endedness-the-last-grand-challenge-youve-never-heard-of\">\"Open-endedness: The last grand challenge you\\'ve never heard of\"</a></li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-neural-architecture-search\\'>What is neural architecture search?.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/Tz2ZNeTeXP4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>', 'links': [{'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/Tz2ZNeTeXP4/what-is-neural-architecture-search', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Liam Li, Ameet Talwalkar'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Liam Li, Ameet Talwalkar'}, 'author': 'Liam Li, Ameet Talwalkar', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-is-neural-architecture-search'}, {'title': 'Four short links: 19 December 2018', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Four short links: 19 December 2018'}, 'updated': '2018-12-19T15:55:00Z', 'updated_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2018, tm_mon=12, tm_mday=19, tm_hour=15, tm_min=55, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=2, tm_yday=353, tm_isdst=0), 'id': 'tag:www.oreilly.com,2018-12-19:/ideas/four-short-links-19-december-2018', 'guidislink': True, 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/eJXMprdPlqk/four-short-links-19-december-2018', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': '<p><em>Observable Notebooks, Disinformation Report, Chained Blocking, and Trivia from 2018</em></p><ol>\\r\\n<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://beta.observablehq.com/\">Observable Notebooks</a> -- JavaScript notebooks.

Since that time, Andrej Karpathy has made some more predictions about the fate of software development: he envisions a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35\">Software 2.0</a>, in which the nature of software development has fundamentally changed. Humans no longer implement code that solves business problems; instead, they define desired behaviors and train algorithms to solve their problems. As he writes, “a neural network is a better piece of code than anything you or I can come up with in a large fraction of valuable verticals.” We won’t be writing code to optimize scheduling in a manufacturing plant; we’ll be training ML algorithms to find optimum performance based on historical data.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If humans are no longer needed to write enterprise applications, what do we do? Humans are still needed to write software, but that software is of a different type. Developers of Software 1.0 have a large body of tools to choose from: IDEs, CI/CD tools, automated testing tools, and so on. The tools for Software 2.0 are only starting to exist; one big task over the next two years is developing the IDEs for machine learning, plus other tools for data management, pipeline management, data cleaning, data provenance, and data lineage.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Karpathy’s vision is ambitious, and we don’t think enterprise software developers need to worry about their jobs any time soon. However, it is clear that the way software is developed is changing. With machine learning, the challenge isn’t writing the code; the algorithms are implemented in a number of well-known and highly optimized libraries. We don’t need to implement our own versions of long short-term memory (LSTM) or reinforcement learning; we get that from <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/\">PyTorch</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ray-project/ray\">Ray RLlib</a>, or some other library. However, machine learning isn’t possible without data, and our tools for working with data aren’t adequate. We have great tools for working with code: creating it, managing it, testing it, and deploying it. But they don’t address the data side, and with ML, managing the data management as important as managing the code itself. GitHub is an excellent tool for managing code, but we need to think about [code+data]. There is no GitHub for data, though we are starting to see version control projects for machine learning models, such as <a href=\"https://dvc.org/\">DVC</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s important to think precisely about what <em>git</em> does. It captures source code, and all the changes to the source code. For any codebase, it can tell you where the code came from (provenance), and all the changes that led from the original commit to the version you downloaded. It’s capable of maintaining many different branches, reflecting different custom views of the code. If someone has changed a line of code, you will see that change, and who made it. And (with some human help and pain) it can resolve conflicting changes on different branches. Those capabilities are all important for data; but good as <em>git</em> is for code, it isn’t adequate for data. It has trouble with data that isn’t formatted as a sequence of lines (like source code), has problems with binary data, and it chokes on huge files. And it is ill-suited for tracking transformations that change every item in a data set, such as a matrix multiplication or normalization.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We also need better tools for collecting data. Given all the talk about the explosion of data, it’s ironic that most of the data that\\'s exploding falls on the floor and is never captured. Data management isn’t limited to issues like provenance and lineage; one of the most important things you can do with data is collect it. Given the rate at which data is created, data collection has to be automated. How do you do that without dropping data? Given that the results produced by any model will reflect the data used to create the model, how do you ensure your data collection process is fair, representative, and unbiased?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Toward a sustainable ML practice</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In our forthcoming report <em>Evolving Data Infrastructure</em>, one aspect we studied was what European organizations were doing to build a sustainable machine learning practice: not a proof of concept or a one-time cool idea to be dropped when the next technical fad comes along, but a permanent part of the organization’s plans. It’s one thing to kick the tires briefly; it’s something else entirely to deeply build the infrastructure needed to integrate machine learning into your organization.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-68jin\"><img alt=\"european organizations machine learning practice\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/image1-79922db797cbb2bc90dce1b37cee75fc.png\"></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Building a sustainable practice means investing in the tools that allow you to work effectively over the long term. These tools enable you to build software you can rely on, not just proof-of-concept hacks that don’t need to be duplicated. These tools include basics like ETL (extract, transform and load: extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it into a form that’s useful, and loading it into a datastore for analysis). It’s no surprise that companies are investing in data science platforms to run machine learning at scale, just as they invested in Hadoop a decade ago. And given that most of the work of a data scientist is cleaning the data prior to analysis, it’s no surprise that most companies are investing in tools for data preparation. These are tools we would have expected to see on the list five years ago as companies started building their data science practices.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We also see investment in new kinds of tools. Anomaly detection is well-known in the financial industry, where it’s frequently used to detect fraudulent transactions, but it can also be used to catch and fix data quality issues automatically. This isn’t surprising; if you’re collecting data from several weather stations and one of them malfunctions, you would expect to see anomalous data. A faulty weather station might stop reporting data (which might be turned into zeros, infinities, or nulls in your data stream), or it might just send readings that are a few degrees above what’s expected, or that are out of line with other stations in the area. In any case, there will be an anomaly in the input data, and it will be easier for a machine to detect that anomaly than a human. If you suddenly see unexpected patterns in your social data, that may mean adversaries are attempting to poison your data sources. Anomaly detection may have originated in finance, but it is becoming a part of every data scientist’s toolkit.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Metadata analysis makes it possible to build data catalogs, which in turn allow humans to discover data that’s relevant to their projects. Democratizing access to data is a major step on the process to becoming a data-driven (or an AI-driven) company; users must be empowered to explore data and to create their own projects. That is difficult without some kind of data catalog. You can tell users they have access to all the data they need, and given them access to databases, but unless they know what data is available and how to find it, that access doesn’t mean anything. Creating that catalog by hand isn’t possible; it needs to be <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-eu/public/schedule/detail/74218\">automated</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data lineage</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The history of data analysis has been plagued with a cavalier attitude toward data sources. That is ending; <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13yUs1iRLotlaMZ55p5-KFzRe4Hwj7iZ3DKkqfnGR93I/edit?ts=5c00789d\">discussions of data ethics</a> have made data scientists aware of the importance of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43383197/what-are-the-differences-between-data-lineage-and-data-provenance/43386224#43386224\">data lineage and provenance</a>. Both refer to the source of the data: where does the data come from, how was it gathered, and how was it modified along the way? Data provenance is increasingly a legal issue; it’s clearly important to know where data came from and how it was obtained. It’s particularly important when you’re combining data from multiple sources; we’ve often observed that data is most powerful when several sources are combined. Provenance can get very complex, particularly when results generated from one set of data are further combined with other data.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s important to be able to trace data lineage at a granular level, to understand the entire path from the source to the application. Data is modified all the time: it’s often been observed that most of the work in data science is cleanup or preparation. Data cleaning involves modifying the data: eliminating rows that have missing or illegal values, for example. We’re beginning to understand exactly how important it is to understand what happened during that cleanup, how data evolved from its raw state: that can be a source of error and bias. As companies ingest and use more data, and as the number of consumers of that data increases, it’s important to know the data is trustworthy. When data is modified, it’s important to track exactly how and when it was modified.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The tools for tracking data provenance and lineage are limited, although products from commercial vendors such as <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/data-lineage/\">Trifacta</a> are starting to appear. Git and its predecessors (SVN and even RCS) can track every change to every line of code in software, maintain multiple branches of the code, and reconcile differences between branches. How do we do that for data? Furthermore, what will we do with the results? It\\'s common to normalize data, or to transform in some way, but such transformations can easily change every byte in the data set.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Not only do such changes pose problems, but tools like git force humans to supply explanatory comments when they commit a new version to explain why any change was made. That\\'s not possible with an automated data pipeline. It might be possible for systems to log and \"explain\" the changes they make, but this assumes you have fine-grained control to force them to do so.</p> \\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Such control may be possible within the scope of a single tool. For example, Jacek Laskowski <a href=\"https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-apache-spark/spark-rdd-lineage.html\">describes</a> how to extract a resilient distributed data set (RDD) lineage graph that describes a series of Spark transformations. This graph could be committed to a lineage tracking system, or even a more traditional version-control system, to document transformations that have been applied to the data.

These tools automate the process of building models: trying different algorithms and topologies, to minimize error when the model is used on test data. But these tools just build models, and we’ve seen that machine learning requires much more. The model can’t exist without tools for data integration and ETL, data preparation, data cleaning, anomaly detection, data governance, and more. Automating model building is just one component of automating machine learning.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To be truly useful, automated machine learning has to go much deeper than model building. It’s too simple to think a machine learning project will require a single model; one project can easily require several different models, doing different things. And different aspects of the business, while superficially similar, can require different models, trained from different data sources. Consider a hotel business such as Marriott: more than 6,000 hotels, and more than $20 billion in gross revenue. Any hotel would like to predict occupancy, income, and the services they need to provide. But each hotel is a completely different business: The Times Square Marriott is dominated by large corporate conferences and New York City tourism, while the Fairfield Inn in Sebastopol is dominated by local events and wine country tourism. The customer demographics are different; but more than that, the event sources are different. The Sebastopol hotel needs to know about local weddings and wine country events; I’d expect them to use natural language processing to parse feeds from local newspapers. The Times Square hotel needs to know about Broadway openings, Yankees games, and Metro-North train schedules. This isn’t just a different model; these two businesses require completely different data pipelines. Automating the model building process is helpful, but it doesn’t go far enough.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Hotels aren’t the only business requiring more models than humans can conceivably build. Salesforce provides AI services for its clients, which number in the hundreds of thousands. Each client needs a custom model; models can’t be shared, even between clients in similar businesses. Aside from confidentiality issues, no two clients have the same customers or the same data, and small differences between clients can add up to large errors. Even with the most optimistic estimates for machine learning talent, there aren’t enough people to build that many models by hand. <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/building-tools-for-enterprise-data-science\">Salesforce’s solution is TransmogrifAI</a>, an open source automated ML library for structured data.

And we need to go even further: beyond simple issues of model accuracy, we need to test for <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning\">fairness and ethics</a>. Those tests can’t be automated completely, but tools can be developed to help domain experts and data scientists detect problems of fairness.

Whether or not we get to Karpathy’s Software 2.0, we’re certainly on a road headed in that direction.

Since that time, Andrej Karpathy has made some more predictions about the fate of software development: he envisions a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35\">Software 2.0</a>, in which the nature of software development has fundamentally changed. Humans no longer implement code that solves business problems; instead, they define desired behaviors and train algorithms to solve their problems. As he writes, “a neural network is a better piece of code than anything you or I can come up with in a large fraction of valuable verticals.” We won’t be writing code to optimize scheduling in a manufacturing plant; we’ll be training ML algorithms to find optimum performance based on historical data.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If humans are no longer needed to write enterprise applications, what do we do? Humans are still needed to write software, but that software is of a different type. Developers of Software 1.0 have a large body of tools to choose from: IDEs, CI/CD tools, automated testing tools, and so on. The tools for Software 2.0 are only starting to exist; one big task over the next two years is developing the IDEs for machine learning, plus other tools for data management, pipeline management, data cleaning, data provenance, and data lineage.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Karpathy’s vision is ambitious, and we don’t think enterprise software developers need to worry about their jobs any time soon. However, it is clear that the way software is developed is changing. With machine learning, the challenge isn’t writing the code; the algorithms are implemented in a number of well-known and highly optimized libraries. We don’t need to implement our own versions of long short-term memory (LSTM) or reinforcement learning; we get that from <a href=\"https://pytorch.org/\">PyTorch</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/ray-project/ray\">Ray RLlib</a>, or some other library. However, machine learning isn’t possible without data, and our tools for working with data aren’t adequate. We have great tools for working with code: creating it, managing it, testing it, and deploying it. But they don’t address the data side, and with ML, managing the data management as important as managing the code itself. GitHub is an excellent tool for managing code, but we need to think about [code+data]. There is no GitHub for data, though we are starting to see version control projects for machine learning models, such as <a href=\"https://dvc.org/\">DVC</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s important to think precisely about what <em>git</em> does. It captures source code, and all the changes to the source code. For any codebase, it can tell you where the code came from (provenance), and all the changes that led from the original commit to the version you downloaded. It’s capable of maintaining many different branches, reflecting different custom views of the code. If someone has changed a line of code, you will see that change, and who made it. And (with some human help and pain) it can resolve conflicting changes on different branches. Those capabilities are all important for data; but good as <em>git</em> is for code, it isn’t adequate for data. It has trouble with data that isn’t formatted as a sequence of lines (like source code), has problems with binary data, and it chokes on huge files. And it is ill-suited for tracking transformations that change every item in a data set, such as a matrix multiplication or normalization.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We also need better tools for collecting data. Given all the talk about the explosion of data, it’s ironic that most of the data that\\'s exploding falls on the floor and is never captured. Data management isn’t limited to issues like provenance and lineage; one of the most important things you can do with data is collect it. Given the rate at which data is created, data collection has to be automated. How do you do that without dropping data? Given that the results produced by any model will reflect the data used to create the model, how do you ensure your data collection process is fair, representative, and unbiased?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Toward a sustainable ML practice</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In our forthcoming report <em>Evolving Data Infrastructure</em>, one aspect we studied was what European organizations were doing to build a sustainable machine learning practice: not a proof of concept or a one-time cool idea to be dropped when the next technical fad comes along, but a permanent part of the organization’s plans. It’s one thing to kick the tires briefly; it’s something else entirely to deeply build the infrastructure needed to integrate machine learning into your organization.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-68jin\"><img alt=\"european organizations machine learning practice\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/image1-79922db797cbb2bc90dce1b37cee75fc.png\"></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Building a sustainable practice means investing in the tools that allow you to work effectively over the long term. These tools enable you to build software you can rely on, not just proof-of-concept hacks that don’t need to be duplicated. These tools include basics like ETL (extract, transform and load: extracting data from multiple sources, transforming it into a form that’s useful, and loading it into a datastore for analysis). It’s no surprise that companies are investing in data science platforms to run machine learning at scale, just as they invested in Hadoop a decade ago. And given that most of the work of a data scientist is cleaning the data prior to analysis, it’s no surprise that most companies are investing in tools for data preparation. These are tools we would have expected to see on the list five years ago as companies started building their data science practices.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We also see investment in new kinds of tools. Anomaly detection is well-known in the financial industry, where it’s frequently used to detect fraudulent transactions, but it can also be used to catch and fix data quality issues automatically. This isn’t surprising; if you’re collecting data from several weather stations and one of them malfunctions, you would expect to see anomalous data. A faulty weather station might stop reporting data (which might be turned into zeros, infinities, or nulls in your data stream), or it might just send readings that are a few degrees above what’s expected, or that are out of line with other stations in the area. In any case, there will be an anomaly in the input data, and it will be easier for a machine to detect that anomaly than a human. If you suddenly see unexpected patterns in your social data, that may mean adversaries are attempting to poison your data sources. Anomaly detection may have originated in finance, but it is becoming a part of every data scientist’s toolkit.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Metadata analysis makes it possible to build data catalogs, which in turn allow humans to discover data that’s relevant to their projects. Democratizing access to data is a major step on the process to becoming a data-driven (or an AI-driven) company; users must be empowered to explore data and to create their own projects. That is difficult without some kind of data catalog. You can tell users they have access to all the data they need, and given them access to databases, but unless they know what data is available and how to find it, that access doesn’t mean anything. Creating that catalog by hand isn’t possible; it needs to be <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-eu/public/schedule/detail/74218\">automated</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data lineage</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The history of data analysis has been plagued with a cavalier attitude toward data sources. That is ending; <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13yUs1iRLotlaMZ55p5-KFzRe4Hwj7iZ3DKkqfnGR93I/edit?ts=5c00789d\">discussions of data ethics</a> have made data scientists aware of the importance of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43383197/what-are-the-differences-between-data-lineage-and-data-provenance/43386224#43386224\">data lineage and provenance</a>. Both refer to the source of the data: where does the data come from, how was it gathered, and how was it modified along the way? Data provenance is increasingly a legal issue; it’s clearly important to know where data came from and how it was obtained. It’s particularly important when you’re combining data from multiple sources; we’ve often observed that data is most powerful when several sources are combined. Provenance can get very complex, particularly when results generated from one set of data are further combined with other data.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It’s important to be able to trace data lineage at a granular level, to understand the entire path from the source to the application. Data is modified all the time: it’s often been observed that most of the work in data science is cleanup or preparation. Data cleaning involves modifying the data: eliminating rows that have missing or illegal values, for example. We’re beginning to understand exactly how important it is to understand what happened during that cleanup, how data evolved from its raw state: that can be a source of error and bias. As companies ingest and use more data, and as the number of consumers of that data increases, it’s important to know the data is trustworthy. When data is modified, it’s important to track exactly how and when it was modified.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The tools for tracking data provenance and lineage are limited, although products from commercial vendors such as <a href=\"https://www.trifacta.com/data-lineage/\">Trifacta</a> are starting to appear. Git and its predecessors (SVN and even RCS) can track every change to every line of code in software, maintain multiple branches of the code, and reconcile differences between branches. How do we do that for data? Furthermore, what will we do with the results? It\\'s common to normalize data, or to transform in some way, but such transformations can easily change every byte in the data set.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Not only do such changes pose problems, but tools like git force humans to supply explanatory comments when they commit a new version to explain why any change was made. That\\'s not possible with an automated data pipeline. It might be possible for systems to log and \"explain\" the changes they make, but this assumes you have fine-grained control to force them to do so.</p> \\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Such control may be possible within the scope of a single tool. For example, Jacek Laskowski <a href=\"https://jaceklaskowski.gitbooks.io/mastering-apache-spark/spark-rdd-lineage.html\">describes</a> how to extract a resilient distributed data set (RDD) lineage graph that describes a series of Spark transformations. This graph could be committed to a lineage tracking system, or even a more traditional version-control system, to document transformations that have been applied to the data. But this process only applies to a single machine learning platform: Spark. To be generally useful, every platform would need to support extracting a lineage graph, preferably in a single format and without requiring additional scripting by developers. That\\'s a good vision for where we need to go, but we\\'re not there yet.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Data provenance and lineage isn’t just about the quality of the results; it’s a security and compliance issue.

    "#### So far we have looked at k-means - a centroid based clustering algorithm and at hierarchical clustering - a conncectivity based clustering algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will look at *density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise* a.k.a. DBSCAN, which is a density based clustering algorithm. DBSCAN clusters points by how close they are together. Typically we will define a threshold of proximity. Points that are closer than the threshold distance will be grouped together in the same cluster. We call this minimum distance epsilon. There are two things that we adjust in DBSCAN - epsilon and the minimum number of points needed to create a cluster. The main advantage of DBSCAN over k-means is that we do not need to specify the number of clusters in advance, instead we specify epsilon and min points. There are some situations where this clustering technique has an advantage over other techniques. We will examine such scenarios below.\n",
